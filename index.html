# Biometric Gait Recognition from Local Video

## Overview
This project focuses on identifying individuals based on their walking patterns (gait) using local video input.
The system processes uploaded gait videos to extract movement features and classify the person.

## Features
- Upload local gait videos (MP4/AVI)
- Simulated gait recognition frontend
- Responsive UI with modern card layout
- Placeholder for backend AI model integration

## Technologies Used
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- Flask / TensorFlow (for backend - to be added later)

## Setup
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Upload any local video file.
3. Click "Process Video" to simulate gait recognition.
4. Backend integration can be linked to `/predict` endpoint later.
